# Learning D3.js 4 Mapping - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Learning D3.js 4 Mapping - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/learning-d3js-4-mapping-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787280175), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book explores the JavaScript library D3. js and its ability to help us create maps and amazing visualizations. You will no longer be confined to third-party tools in order to get a nice looking map. With D3. js, you can build your own maps and customize them as you please. This book will go from the basics of SVG, Canvas, and JavaScript, through to data trimming and modification with TopoJSON. Using D3. js to glue together these key ingredients, we will create very attractive maps that cover many common use cases, such as choropleths, data overlays on maps, interactivity, and performance.
